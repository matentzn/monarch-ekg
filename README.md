# The Monarch Organisational Knowledge Graph (Schema)

## What is this?

This is a [LinkML](https://github.com/biolink/biolinkml/) project, describing the schema of the Monarch Organisational Knowledge Graph (Monarch EKG). The abbreviation EKG was chosen because its an established nomenclature to call such knowledge graphs "enterprise" knowledge graphs - however here, it seems that the term enterprise does not quite fit.

The purpose of the Monarch EKG is to link people, projects and organisations in the wider Monarch Sphere to project goals, and spot opportunities for aligment. A secondary goal is to serve as a simple tutorial for building a KG from scratch using LinkML and KGX.
